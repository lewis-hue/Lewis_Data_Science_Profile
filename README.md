This project demonstrates a comprehensive sales data analysis using **SQL** within **Databricks** on **Microsoft Azure**. The analysis covers product-level revenue, units sold, store performance, and geographic trends. A robust **ETL pipeline** was developed in Databricks to ingest and process transactional sales data across countries and stores. Key business insights were visualized via interactive dashboards to support strategic decision-making.

**Skills & Tools:** SQL, Databricks, Microsoft Azure, Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Sales Analytics, ETL Pipelines, Dashboarding, Retail Analytics
