This project demonstrates a comprehensive sales data analysis using **SQL** within **Databricks** on **Microsoft Azure**. The analysis covers product-level revenue, units sold, store performance, and geographic trends. A robust **ETL pipeline** was developed in Databricks to ingest and process transactional sales data across countries and stores. Key business insights were visualized via interactive dashboards to support strategic decision-making.

**Skills & Tools:** SQL, Databricks, Microsoft Azure, Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Sales Analytics, ETL Pipelines, Dashboarding, Retail Analytics

This project focuses on customer behavior analytics using **R** in **R Studio**, exploring the relationship between `TotalPurchase`, `Frequency`, and `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)` through exploratory data analysis and correlation testing. Visualizations include bar graphs and scatterplots, supported by statistical metrics (correlation coefficients and p-values) to uncover actionable insights. 


**Skills & Tools:** R, R Studio, Data Analysis, Correlation Analysis, Data Visualization, Customer Segmentation, CLV Modeling, Business Intelligence, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Testing
